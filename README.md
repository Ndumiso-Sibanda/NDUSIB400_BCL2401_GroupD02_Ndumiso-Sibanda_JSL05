Guardian Playlists Project
Overview
The Guardian Playlists project is a web app that makes playlists for each Guardian based on their favorite music genre. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website that works well on both computers and phones.

What I Learned
While working on this project, I learned how to:

Change arrays and objects in JavaScript.
Use the map() function to change data.
Update the website while people use it.
Make the website look good on different screens.
Make sure the website is easy to use for everyone.
Fix lists so they don't have dots.
Challenges I Had
When I was making this project, I had some problems:

Removing Dots: I had trouble getting rid of the dots in the playlists. To fix it, I used JavaScript to take away the dots by changing the style of the <ul> element.

Making Elements: It was hard to make new parts of the website for each Guardian's playlist. But I figured it out by using JavaScript to add new parts to the page.

Making the Website Fit: Making sure the website looks good on different screens was also tricky. I used CSS to change the layout based on the screen size.

Solutions I Found
To solve these problems, I did the following:

Removing Dots Dynamically: I used JavaScript to remove the dots from the playlists, making the layout cleaner.

Using JavaScript for Elements: I used JavaScript to create and add new parts to the website for each Guardian's playlist, making the website more dynamic.

Responsive Design: I used CSS to make the website adjust its layout based on the size of the screen, ensuring it looks good on all devices.

Goals I Achieved
By completing this project, I achieved the following goals:

Made a working website that creates playlists based on user choices.
Improved my skills in JavaScript and working with website elements.
Learned more about CSS and how to make websites that look good on different devices.
Solved problems by researching and trying different solutions.
Overall, the Guardian Playlists project helped me learn more about web development and how to build websites that people can interact with easily.
